In a similar fashion, digital education is the innovative use of digital tools and technologies during teaching and learning. It is otherwise referred to as Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) or e-Learning. Digital literacy affords educators the opportunity to design relevant, engaging learning experiences in their various subject areas and deliver lessons in a more efficient way. Digital education can either be taken fully online or together with the traditional form as a blended classroom. It is expected that 21st century learners would take a cue from its import and adjust their learning in the right direction.</p>
